"""Refresh every per-expansion/content-type pack repo from the current
Sounds/ + SoundLengths.lua, and push it.

This is the step that was done by hand today: build_sound_packs.py, then for
each pack directory, clone its repo fresh, replace the content, commit if
anything changed, push. Doing it by hand does not scale past a handful of
repos and is exactly the kind of step that gets skipped under time pressure,
which is how a pack repo goes stale against the library silently.

A fresh clone each run (not a persistent local checkout) trades a slower run
for zero state to get wrong -- no stale branch, no leftover merge conflict
from a run that died halfway, nothing to resync by hand.

build_sound_packs.py can now split one oversized pack (e.g. Classic, once it
crosses --max-pack-mb) into several sequential sub-packs -- Classic_Part1,
Classic_Part2, etc. Each of those is just another directory under the build
output, named QuestReaderAddon_Pack_Classic_Part1 and so on, so this script
needed no structural change to *handle* them: the existing "one repo per
pack directory name" loop already treats a sub-pack exactly like any other
pack. What it did need: (1) never assume a repo already exists -- a
newly-split pack has no repo yet, by definition, so a clean, unambiguous
report of exactly which repo names this run expects, up front, before
touching git at all, so a missing repo is a known, expected gap rather than
a cryptic clone failure buried in the middle of a long run; and (2) the
"never publish Unsorted" rule has to match Unsorted_Part1, Unsorted_Part2,
etc. too, not just the literal name "Unsorted".

This script never creates a GitHub repo itself -- see the summary printed at
the end for exactly which repo(s) the owner still needs to create by hand.

Usage:
    python tools/publish_packs.py --github-user dandwhelan
    python tools/publish_packs.py --github-user dandwhelan --only Midnight,Classic
    python tools/publish_packs.py --github-user dandwhelan --dry-run
    python tools/publish_packs.py --github-user dandwhelan --max-pack-mb 500
