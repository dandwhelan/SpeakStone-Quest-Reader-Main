"""Generate quest voiceovers from harvested text and extracted reference audio.

Takes the passages produced by wowhead_quests.py or harvest_export.py, matches
each speaker to the reference clips extracted for that NPC, and synthesizes one
audio file per passage named as the addon expects: <questID>_<passage>.ogg.

The default engine is Coqui XTTS-v2, which clones zero-shot from a few seconds
of reference audio and outputs at 24 kHz — the same rate as the audio the addon
already ships. It needs a GPU to be practical and is imported only when
generation actually runs, so planning works on any machine.

Work is resumable. Existing output files are skipped, so an interrupted run
continues where it stopped rather than regenerating everything.

Usage:
    synthesize.py passages.json --reference ./reference-audio --dry-run
    synthesize.py passages.json --reference ./reference-audio -o ./generated
    synthesize.py passages.json --reference ./ref -o ./gen --only 95300,95301

# to steer by: on a clip whose pitch is bimodal the estimator's median jumps
# between modes, and the correction then points the wrong way. Matching a
# whole voice needs a target measured across a speaker, not one utterance.
