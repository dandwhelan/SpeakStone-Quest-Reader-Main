"""Re-encode the shipped library's genuine PCM as Ogg Vorbis.

The library is not what its filenames suggest. Of 5,238 files carrying a
.wav extension, 71% (4,449 files, 962 MB) are already MP3 inside a .wav
wrapper -- the game sniffs content rather than trusting the extension, so
they have always played correctly. Only the remaining 29% (788 files,
392 MB) is genuine PCM. Content is sniffed here the same way, so only that
slice is ever re-encoded: the rest is already compressed, and putting it
through Vorbis too would decode-and-recompress audio that does not need it,
trading quality for bytes that were mostly not there to save. Measured on
the genuine-PCM slice, quality 4 is roughly an 88% reduction.

Size matters more here than in a normal audio library. Every past content drop
is retained in git history, so the repository is already several times the size
of the working tree, and each future patch of WAVs compounds it.

Conversion does not touch the originals unless --replace is given:

    convert_library.py ../Sounds --dry-run
    convert_library.py ../Sounds -o ../Sounds-ogg

Be careful what -o contains. Only the converted files are written there:
already-compressed .wav is skipped and existing .ogg is not copied, so the
output is a fraction of the library rather than a version of it. Rebuilding
the index from that directory would drop every entry it does not happen to
contain -- around 6,800 of them -- leaving most of the shipped audio invisible
to the addon, which reads the index and not the disk:

    # WRONG. Indexes only the converted slice and discards the rest.
    build_soundlengths.py ../Sounds-ogg -o ../SoundLengths.lua

Adopt a conversion by merging it into the library first, then rebuilding from
the whole thing, and check the entry count went up rather than down:

    cp -r ../Sounds-ogg/. ../Sounds/
    build_soundlengths.py ../Sounds -o ../SoundLengths.lua

`run_batch.py --install` does that with a backup and a gate that refuses an
index smaller than the one it replaces.

Requires ffmpeg, either on PATH or via `pip install imageio-ffmpeg`.
