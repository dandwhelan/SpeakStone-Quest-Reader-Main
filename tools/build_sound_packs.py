"""Split the monolithic Sounds/ + SoundLengths.lua into per-expansion packs.

Each output pack is a self-contained addon directory: its own .toc, its own
Sounds/, and its own SoundLengths.lua shard under a pack-specific global name.
See packs/QuestReaderAddon_Pack_Cataclysm/ for what one looks like once built,
and QuestReaderAddon.lua's QuestReaderAddon_RegisterSoundPack for how a pack's
index gets merged into the base addon at runtime.

This script only reads Sounds/ and SoundLengths.lua. It never writes into
either -- packs are written to a new output directory (default: packs/), and
an existing pack directory is refused unless --force, in which case it is
backed up first, not overwritten in place.

WHERE THE EXPANSION FOR A QUEST COMES FROM, AND ITS LIMITS
------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is no expansion field on quests anywhere in this repo. QuestV2.csv
(tools/.cache/QuestV2.csv, a dump of the client's QuestV2 table) carries only
ID, UniqueBitFlag and UiQuestDetailsThemeID -- no zone, no expansion. Nothing
else cached here (Creature.csv, the listfile, vo-index.json) carries it
either, and voice_sources.py's --patch filtering is about which patch a
piece of *Blizzard reference audio* was recorded for, which is unrelated to
which expansion a *quest* belongs to.

The one thing that does carry it: tools/.cache/wowhead/<questID>.html, the
per-quest pages already fetched by wowhead_quests.py for quest text, each
carry a line like:
    Added in World of Warcraft: The War Within
This script parses that line for whatever quests happen to be in the cache
(2,043 pages as of writing, of ~66,000 quest IDs in QuestV2 -- a few percent).
Coverage will grow for free as wowhead_quests.py fetches more quests for text,
but it is NOT complete today, and a quest whose page was never fetched, or
whose page lacked that line (dead/renamed/blocked pages do happen -- see the
"unmapped" count this script prints), has no known expansion.

Quests with no known expansion are NOT guessed at and NOT dropped. They go
into a pack named "Unsorted" so their audio still ships and still plays; it
is just not expansion-sorted yet. If real coverage matters, the fix is a
dedicated scrape: either keep growing the wowhead cache (it costs nothing,
this script just needs to be re-run), or scrape wowhead's per-expansion quest
listing pages directly, which return the full ID set for an expansion in one
pass instead of one page per quest.

Gossip and item/book audio (npc<id>_gossip<n>, item<id>_page<n>, and friends)
has no quest ID to look anything up by, and an NPC or item can span many
expansions anyway. That audio always goes into a pack named "Shared", which
is the one pack an install should always have alongside any expansion packs.

    """Split one oversized pack into sequential, ID-ordered volumes.

    Design, and why this beats the alternatives considered:

    - Zone/continent split was ruled out: nothing cached in this repo (see
      the module docstring and docs/sound_packs.md section 3) carries a
      quest's zone or continent, only its expansion (and that itself is
      only ~10% directly mapped, filled out by quest_expansions.json).
      Designing around zone data that doesn't exist would just move the
      "Unsorted" problem down a level.
    - Level bracket has the same problem: no level field exists anywhere in
      QuestV2.csv or the harvested JSON. Ruled out for the same reason.
    - A naive "just split what's over budget into two even halves each
      run" was rejected because re-running it after the library grows would
      recompute different boundaries and silently reshuffle which clips are
      in "Part1" vs "Part2" -- an existing install of Part1 would suddenly
      be missing clips it used to have (they moved to a renamed/renumbered
      Part2) with no error, just silence. That is worse than the 500MB
      problem it's meant to solve.

    What this does instead: sort this pack's entries by numeric_sort_key
    (a fixed, reproducible order -- not zone or level, just deterministic),
    then greedily fill "PartN" volumes to ~90% of max_bytes. The boundary
    (highest numeric key) at which a volume was sealed is written to
    pack_split_state.json and never revisited: on every future run, any
    entry whose key falls at or under a frozen boundary goes to that same
    already-published Part, full stop, even if that makes the frozen part
    quietly exceed the cap by a few clips (a warning is printed; it is not
    silently ignored). Only the newest, still-open Part absorbs new growth,
    and if IT crosses the cap, a new boundary is sealed and a new Part is
    opened. Existing installs of Part1..Part(n-1) are therefore never
    invalidated by later growth -- only a new PartN ever appears.

    Trade-off, stated plainly: the very first time a given pack crosses the
    cap, its previously-unsplit name changes (e.g.
    QuestReaderAddon_Pack_Classic becomes ..._Part1,
    ..._Part2, ...). That is a one-time, unavoidable break of that pack's
    existing repo name/identity -- there is no way to keep serving the same
    growing pack from the same single file once it must physically split.
    Once split, though, later growth is additive, not disruptive.

    The ordering is quest-ID order, not any meaningful player-facing axis
    (not story order, not zone, not level) -- a player picking "Part 2"
    has no idea what's actually inside beyond "some more Classic quests".
    This is the honest cost of not having zone/level data; see the
    accompanying design writeup for what to switch to (zone-based) once/if
    that data becomes available.
