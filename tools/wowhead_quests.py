"""Fetch quest text and speakers from Wowhead.

Quest text is server-delivered and absent from the client database, so it has
to come from somewhere that records it. The harvester addon reads it from a
live client; this reads it from Wowhead, which holds it because players upload
it. Both produce the same records, so the synthesis stage does not care which
was used.

The tradeoff between them is worth understanding:

    harvester   authoritative, uses only public API, needs the content played
    Wowhead     covers everything at once, but lags a patch by days and is a
                third party's data under their terms of use

Wowhead's terms do not permit scraping. This is the route the original project
used, and the addon's own README alludes to it ("the source I utilize for quest
info can sometimes take several days"), but it is a deliberate choice rather
than an obviously safe default. Requests are rate-limited and cached so a rerun
costs nothing, and the default pace is deliberately unhurried.

Usage:
    wowhead_quests.py --ids missing.txt -o passages.json
    wowhead_quests.py --ids missing.txt --delay 2.0 --format csv -o out.csv
