# SpeakStone Narration (QuestReaderAddon)

A WoW addon that plays AI-generated voiceovers for quest text, books/items, and gossip, cloned from each NPC's own in-game dialogue. `tools/` holds the regeneration pipeline that produces that audio. Read `tools/README.md` before touching the pipeline — it's the authoritative, detailed reference; this file is orientation and safety rules, not a duplicate of it.

## Layout

- `QuestReaderAddon.lua`, `QuestReaderAddon_Settings.lua`, `QuestAudioLibraryUI.lua`, `.toc` — the core addon.
- `SoundLengths.lua` — the index the addon reads before playing anything. A clip missing from this file is invisible to the addon even if the audio file exists on disk. **This file is real user data, not a build artifact.**
- `Sounds/` — the shipped audio library, currently 5,000+ files. Most filenames end `.wav` but a majority of those are actually MP3 with a `.wav` extension (see below) — never assume the extension tells you the format. Newer files are `.ogg`.
- `tools/` — the regeneration pipeline (Python 3, stdlib-only except where a script says otherwise). Has its own README with full usage.
- `tools/QuestReaderHarvester/` — a small companion addon (SpeakStone Harvester) that captures quest, gossip, and item/book text live from a running client for content that cannot be scraped.

## Non-negotiable safety rules

- **Never run `build_soundlengths.py -o` pointed at the real `SoundLengths.lua` without a backup first**, and always verify the entry count after: it should equal old-count + new-clips, never less. A rebuild that silently drops entries is worse than no rebuild.
- **`Sounds/` originals are not deleted automatically**, even after a successful re-encode to Ogg. Deleting real shipped audio is the user's call after they've confirmed playback in-game — never do it as part of a "cleanup."
- Anything under `tools/.cache/` is a rebuildable cache, safe to delete. Anything in `Sounds/`, `SoundLengths.lua`, or a user's live AddOns install is not.
- **If syncing changes into a live WoW install (`.../Interface/AddOns/QuestReaderAddon` or `QuestReaderHarvester`), back up whatever's already there first** (`.backup_<timestamp>`) — it may be a version the user is actively testing.

## Audio Naming Schemes

- **Quests:** `<questID>_<passage>.<ext>` (`description`, `progress`, `completion`)
- **Gossip:** `npc<npcID>_gossip<n>.<ext>` (e.g., `npc12345_gossip1.ogg`)
- **Items & Books:** `item<itemID>_page<page>.<ext>` or `item_<clean_name>_page<page>.<ext>` or `<clean_name>_page<page>.<ext>`
- Supported audio extensions: `.ogg` (preferred/new), `.wav`.

## What's already been solved (don't rediscover these)

- **wago.tools returns HTTP 403 to urllib's default User-Agent.** Every script that hits it (`missing_quests.py`, `npc_traits.py`, `voice_sources.py`) sends a real one. If you add a new client-table fetch, do the same.
- **The original `TTS` (Coqui) PyPI package is archived and won't install on Python 3.12+.** Use the `coqui-tts` fork, which provides the same `TTS` module.
- **torch ≥2.9 requires `torchcodec`, which needs FFmpeg *shared* libraries.** The usual Windows ffmpeg builds are static-only, so torchcodec fails to load with a cryptic `WinError 127` — after the model has already loaded, which makes it look like a model problem, not a codec one. Fix: uninstall `torchcodec` (F5-TTS) or pin `torch==2.8.*` (XTTS). Both engines fall back to torchaudio cleanly once torchcodec is out of the picture.
- **The two TTS engines don't share a venv well.** `.venv/` = XTTS, `.venv-f5/` = F5-TTS (the default). Both are gitignored.
- **F5-TTS is the default engine, not XTTS**, chosen after a direct measured comparison (see `tools/README.md` and `tools/synthesize.py`'s module constants for the numbers). Don't silently switch it back.
- **Reference budget is 60 seconds, not the "less is more" value a lot of cloning advice suggests.** That was deliberately tested at 12/30/60s by ear against real NPCs and 60 won. This only matters for NPCs with enough reference clips to hit the budget in the first place.
- **The Lua SavedVariables parser turns array-style Lua tables (`{"a","b"}`) into a Python dict keyed `"1","2",...`, not a list.** Code that reads harvester output learned this the hard way — check `isinstance(x, dict)` and sort numeric keys, not `isinstance(x, list)`.
- **Quest text and gossip text are both absent from client data files.** Verified directly against the actual DB2 definitions for the current build, not assumed. Quest text has a Wowhead-scraping fallback; gossip text does not — it can only come from the harvester addon being played with. Don't go looking for a gossip DB2 table; there isn't one.
- **Wowhead rate-limits.** `wowhead_quests.py` retries 403/429 with exponential backoff and writes whatever it gathered if the block outlasts that, rather than losing a long run's progress. Don't run two fetches against the cache at once — it roughly halves the effective pacing and is the likely cause of an early rate-limit incident.
- **71% of the shipped `.wav` library is actually MP3 in a `.wav` wrapper.** Only the genuine-PCM slice (29%) should ever be re-encoded — `convert_library.py` checks the `fmt` chunk's format tag, not just the RIFF/WAVE header, before touching a file. Re-encoding an already-lossy file is a real quality cost for little to no size benefit.

## Conventions

- Pronunciation fixes go in `tools/pronunciations.json`, added only after actually hearing a name mispronounced in generated audio and checking the respelling against the game's own voice-over — never guessed in advance.
- Voice bank donor choices for NPCs with no audio of their own are a judgement call, not something to leave silently unfilled. Document the reasoning in the commit when picking one.
- Commit messages in this repo explain *why*, generally at some length — match that style rather than terse one-liners, especially for anything fixing a bug that wasn't obvious from the symptom.
